- This is a revamped version of the original case study that I worked on for DataCamp's **"Data Scientist Associate certification".**
- The dataset as well as the problem scenario was provided by DataCamp. 
- In this report I will be working on a fictitious business scenario, dealing with a customer behaviour classification problem. 
- I will clean the data, validate it, do some visual insepction of the data and then work on modelling it. 


## 1. Scenario

- GoalZone is a fitness club chain in Canada.
- GoalZone offers a range of fitness classes in two capacities - 25 and 15.
- Some classes are always fully booked. Fully booked classes often have a low attendance rate.
- GoalZone wants to increase the number of spaces available for classes.
- They want to do this by predicting whether the member will attend the class or not.
- If they can predict a member will not attend the class, they can make another space
  available.

## 2. Data

```{python}

# Importing the necessary modules
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
plt.style.use("seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid")

# let's get the data
url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/talent-assets.datacamp.com/fitness_class_2212.csv"

# this will fetch the data and put it into a dataframe. 
from utils.functions import read_data
data = read_data(url=url)

data.head()
```

**The data has 8 columns and 1500 rows**<br>
The basic descriptions of the columns are.<br> 


1. unique booking id
2. The number of months as this fitness club member
3. weight 
4. The number of days before the class the member registered
5. day of week of the class
6. time of class
7. category
8. The last column attended shows whether the member attended the class or not with 0 corresponding to "No" and 1 to "Yes".


## 3. Defining the problem
- **The business wants to predict whether members will attend using the data provided**
- Since our target variable is binary this is essentially a **Binary Classification** problem
- We have to predict whether the member who has registered for the class will attend the class or not. 

Now that we have taken a glimpse of the data, decided what our end goal is let's get into the actual analysis. we will go through this step by step by first validating the data then doing some Exploratory analysis and finally training some machine learning models. 

## 4. Data cleaning and validation. 
<br>
Let's take a look at some information about the columns 

1. "months_as_member" : 1 is minimum value for this column
2. "weight" : 40.00 is minimum value
3. "days_before" : 1 is minimum value
4. "day_of_week" : "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun" are valid values
5. "time" : "AM" , "PM" are valid values
6. "category" : "Yoga", "Aqua" , "Strength", "HIIT", "Cycling", "unknown" are valid values
7. "attended" : 1, 0 are valid values

Below I'm creating a python dictionary that contains some metadata about the data we have. This will be used later on to validate the integrity of the data. 

```{python}

data_dict = {"booking_id"  : "The unique identifier of the booking.",

                "months_as_member" : 1, # minimum value for this column

                "weight" : 40.00, # minimum value

                "days_before" : 1, # minimum value

                "day_of_week" : ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"], # valid categories

                "time" : ["AM" , "PM"], # valid categories

                "category" : ["Yoga", "Aqua" , "Strength", "HIIT", "Cycling", "unknown"], # valid categories

                "attended" : [1, 0] # valid categories
                }
```


#### Let's take a look at what kind of problems the data has. <br>
first we will check the categorical columns 

```{python, attr.output='.details summary="Output"'}
#| output: false
# Select the categorical columns
# Print value counts for each of those columns
for column in data.select_dtypes("object").columns:        
    print(f"{column} :\n{data[column].value_counts()} \n") 
```


**I have disabled the output here because it is very long but you can execute the code and take a look at it**<br>
**The problems identified in the categorical columns are**

1. The days before column is not completely numeric and some cells have "days" string written alongside the number of days. This is data entry incosistency and needs to be fixed. 
2. The day of the week also has data entry errors and the weekday names aren't consistent. 
3. The time columns seems fine
4. category column has "-" as values in few columns which will need to be replaced. 


**I will peform series of operations on the data and fix the problems mentioned above.**

 1) first we fix the days before column by elimination string characters from it
 2) next we fixed the day_of_week column by using the function defind above
 3) then fix the category column by replacing "-" with "unknown"
 4) after that we change the datatypes of the columns
 5) lastly drop the "booking_id" column as it is not useful



```{python}

# this is a function to fix the day_of_week column
def fix_dow(df):
    df['day_of_week'] = df['day_of_week'].str.replace('Fri.', "Fri")
    df['day_of_week'] = df['day_of_week'].str.replace('Monday', "Mon")
    df['day_of_week'] = df['day_of_week'].str.replace('Wednesday', "Wed")
    return df['day_of_week']

# this fuction will carry out cleaning steps outlined above
def clean_data(data = data):
    return (data
            .assign(days_before = data['days_before'].str.extract(r'(\d+)'),
                    day_of_week = fix_dow,
                    category = data['category'].replace("-", "unknown"))
            .astype({"days_before":"int", "day_of_week":"category", "time":"category", 
                     "category":"category", "attended":"category"})
            .drop("booking_id", axis=1) # drop booking id column
           )
# let's store the clean dataframe in a new variable
clean_data = clean_data()
clean_data.head()
```


We can look at the output of the cleaned data. Let's validate it for using the function that was defined previously. 

```{python}
from utils import validate
validate(clean_data, data_dict)
```
as we can see the data has passed the validation tests that were defined. <br>

#### Does the data have missing values?


```{python}
print(clean_data.isna().sum())
```


- it looks like the weight column has few missing values
- we will have to impute these values later before we train the model
- let's keep going for now <br>
**This ends the section on data validation and cleaning. Now we will start analyzing the data**

## 5. Visual inspection
- now that we have cleaned the data it is time to start analyzing it. 
- Let's take a look at basic summary statistics for the numerical variables

```{python}
clean_data.describe()
```
it doesn't look like there are any anomalies in this data. so we can keep going


#### Let's see the distribution of our target variable. 
```{python}
#| fig-align: center
ax = sns.countplot(data = clean_data, x = 'attended', width=0.5)
ax.set_xticklabels(labels=['No', 'Yes'])
ax.set_yticks([])
ax.bar_label(ax.containers[0], label_type='center', color='black')
ax.set_xlabel("Attended the class or not?");
```
- We can see that the amount of people that did not attend the class is more than twice the amount of the people that did attend the class
- So the classes for our target variable are imbalanced 


#### Next we will take a look at the "months_as_member" column
```{python}
#| fig-align: center
sns.histplot(data = clean_data, x = 'months_as_member', kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of "months as member"');
```
- The distribution is right skewed 
- It looks like most of the members have been members for between 1 to 20 months and then there's smaller proportion of people who have been members for longer than that.
- There are few outliers here who have been members a lot longer than everyone else which have given a long right tail to the distribution
